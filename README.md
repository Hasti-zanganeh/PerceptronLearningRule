# 🧠 Perceptron Learning Rule for Two-Input AND Gate

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Perceptron Learning Rule** by training a **single-layer perceptron** to learn the **two-input AND gate** function. The model updates its **weights and bias** over multiple epochs, adjusting the decision boundary dynamically. 

By the **fifth epoch**, the perceptron successfully classifies all inputs correctly, achieving convergence. The **decision boundary evolution** is visualized to illustrate the learning process.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Implements Perceptron Learning Rule**  
✅ **Trains a perceptron on AND-gate logic**  
✅ **Visualizes decision boundary for each epoch**  
✅ **Demonstrates convergence in training**  
✅ **Uses NumPy and Matplotlib for computation & visualization**

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required dependencies.

### **📦 Install Required Libraries**
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib

## 📊 Results & Visualization
### **1️⃣ Convergence of the Model**
- The perceptron **converges in 5 epochs**, meaning the weights stabilize, and all classifications become correct.

### **2️⃣ Decision Boundary Evolution**
- The **decision boundary changes** dynamically as weights are updated.
- The **final boundary correctly classifies all points**.
