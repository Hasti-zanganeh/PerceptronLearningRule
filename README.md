# ðŸ§  Perceptron Learning Rule for Two-Input AND Gate

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **Perceptron Learning Rule** by training a **single-layer perceptron** to learn the **two-input AND gate** function. The model updates its **weights and bias** over multiple epochs, adjusting the decision boundary dynamically. 

By the **fifth epoch**, the perceptron successfully classifies all inputs correctly, achieving convergence. The **decision boundary evolution** is visualized to illustrate the learning process.
